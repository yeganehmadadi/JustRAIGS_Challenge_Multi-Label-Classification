This is an example repository for how to make an algorithm submission for the [JustRAIGS challenge]:https://justraigs.grand-challenge.org/. This algorithm is just for inference of your model.

You can upload your algorithms <a href="https://justraigs.grand-challenge.org/">here</a>. If you have a verified account on Grand Challenge and are accepted as a participant in the JustRAIGS challenge, you should be able to submit your Docker container. If something does not work for you, please do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:yeganeh.madadi@gmail.com) or add a post to the [forum]().
